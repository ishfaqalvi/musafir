                                    The Customer is responsible for ensuring that their device is eSim compatible and network-unlocked. Device compatibility may depend on the carrier and country of origin; the Customer must check the list of eSim-compatible devices provided at the checkout. By checking the box that confirms that the Customer's device is eSim compatible, the Customer is then held responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide.

                                    The eSim compatibility list is not exhaustive, meaning newly announced eSim-compatible devices may still need to be added.

                                    The service contract between Musafir and the Customer begins upon completing the order on the Musafir website (https://www.musafir.com, including any subdomains associated with Musafir), via the Musafir app, through our APIs, on the Partner Platform, or via any other product provided by Musafir that allows customers to make an order.

                                    The Activation of the eSim and acknowledgment of the Activation Policy is the Customer's responsibility.

                                <p>
                                    The contract will be terminated for End Users if they do not have an active data package or have deleted the eSim from the target device. However, for Business Users, the termination of the contract is subject to the terms of any specific agreement signed between the Business User and Musafir, or their active status on the Partner Platform. For Business Users with such agreements or active platform participation, the contract remains in effect even in the absence of an active data package or if an eSim is deleted from a device, reflecting the ongoing partnership and commitments between Musafir and the Business User.

                                <h3>4.2.5. Postpaid Transactions for Business Users</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Postpaid transactions represent a flexible payment model tailored for Business Users, offering the convenience of receiving eSim and top-up packages prior to payment. This approach aligns with the needs of businesses seeking operational flexibility and efficiency in managing their connectivity solutions. A postpaid transaction allows Business Users to receive eSim, top-ups, and other Musafir products and services, with the payment obligation arising at a later date. The specifics of this payment arrangement, including the due date and payment terms, are clearly outlined in the invoice provided by Musafir. This method facilitates immediate access to necessary services while ensuring payment flexibility.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    4.2.5.1. Credit Limit System: To support this model, Musafir may implement a credit limit system. This system authorizes Business Users to utilize credit for purchasing eSim, top-ups, and other Musafir products and services to a predetermined amount. The setting of these credit limits can be determined unilaterally by Musafir or negotiated with the Business User, depending on the agreement's terms. This feature is designed to offer businesses a manageable and scalable way to meet their connectivity needs without immediate financial outlay.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    4.2.5.2. Eligibility Criteria: It is important to note that not all Business Users automatically qualify for postpaid payment options. Musafir reserves the right to select eligible customers based on various criteria, ensuring that this payment model aligns with the business practices and risk management policies of both parties. Criteria for eligibility may include, but are not limited to, the Business User's transaction history, creditworthiness, and the duration of the business relationship with Musafir. By offering postpaid transactions, Musafir aims to provide a high degree of flexibility and trust to its Business Users, allowing them to prioritize their operational requirements while managing payments in a manner that suits their financial workflows.

                                <p>
                                    Musafir implements an eSIM recycling process to ensure optimal service delivery. Upon eSIM purchase, customers are required to activate the eSIM within a specified time frame, as indicated in the activation guidelines provided during the purchase process. It is the user's responsibility to activate the purchased eSIM within the designated time frame. Failing to activate the eSIM within this period may lead to its expiration, rendering the eSIM unusable.
                                    Once expired, the eSIM cannot be reactivated, and the user will need to initiate a new purchase if they wish to obtain a functioning eSIM. Users are advised to review and adhere to the provided activation guidelines to ensure a seamless eSIM activation process.
